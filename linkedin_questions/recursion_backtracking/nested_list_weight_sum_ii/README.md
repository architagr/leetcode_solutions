## Nested List Weight Sum II

### Description 
You are given a nested list of integers `nestedList`. Each element is either an integer or a list whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

The **depth** of an integer is the number of lists that it is inside of. For example, the nested list `[1,[2,2],[[3],2],1]` has each integer's value set to its **depth**. Let `maxDepth` be the **maximum depth** of any integer.

The weight of an integer is `maxDepth - (the depth of the integer) + 1`.

Return the sum of each integer in `nestedList` multiplied by its **weight**.


#### Example 1:
![Example 1](nestedlistweightsumiiex1.png "Example 1")
```
Input: nestedList = [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
Output: 8
Explanation: Four 1's with a weight of 1, one 2 with a weight of 2.
1*1 + 1*1 + 2*2 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 8
```

#### Example 2:
![Example 2](nestedlistweightsumiiex2.png "Example 2")
```
Input: nestedList = [1,[4,[6]]]
Output: 17
Explanation: One 1 at depth 3, one 4 at depth 2, and one 6 at depth 1.
1*3 + 4*2 + 6*1 = 17
 ```

#### Constraints:

- `1 <= nestedList.length <= 50`
- The values of the integers in the nested list is in the range `[-100, 100]`.
- The maximum **depth** of any integer is less than or equal to `50`.
- There are no empty lists.
