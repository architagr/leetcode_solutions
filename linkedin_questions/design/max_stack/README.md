## Max Heap

Design a max stack data structure that supports the stack operations and supports finding the stack's maximum element.

Implement the `MaxStack` class:

- `MaxStack()` Initializes the stack object.
- `void push(int x)` Pushes element `x` onto the stack.
- `int pop()` Removes the element on top of the stack and returns it.
- `int top()` Gets the element on the top of the stack without removing it.
- `int peekMax()` Retrieves the maximum element in the stack without removing it.
- `int popMax()` Retrieves the maximum element in the stack and removes it. If there is more than one maximum element, only remove the top-most one.

You must come up with a solution that supports `O(1)` for each `top` call and `O(logn)` for each other call.

#### Example 1:

```
Input
["MaxStack", "push", "push", "push", "top", "popMax", "top", "peekMax", "pop", "top"]
[[], [5], [1], [5], [], [], [], [], [], []]
Output
[null, null, null, null, 5, 5, 1, 5, 1, 5]

Explanation
MaxStack stk = new MaxStack();
stk.push(5); // [5] the top of the stack and the maximum number is 5.
stk.push(1); // [5, 1] the top of the stack is 1, but the maximum is 5.
stk.push(5); // [5, 1, 5] the top of the stack is 5, which is also the maximum, because it is the top most one.
stk.top(); // return 5, [5, 1, 5] the stack did not change.
stk.popMax(); // return 5, [5, 1] the stack is changed now, and the top is different from the max.
stk.top(); // return 1, [5, 1] the stack did not change.
stk.peekMax(); // return 5, [5, 1] the stack did not change.
stk.pop(); // return 1, [5] the top of the stack and the max element is now 5.
stk.top(); // return 5, [5] the stack did not change.
```

#### Constraints:

- `-10^7 <= x <= 10^7`
- At most `10^5` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `top`, `peekMax`, and `popMax`.
- There will be at least one element in the stack when `pop`, `top`, `peekMax`, or `popMax` is called.
