## Closest Binary Search Tree Value II

Given the `root` of a binary search tree, a `target` value, and an integer `k`, return the `k` values in the BST that are closest to the `target`. You may return the answer in **any order**.

You are `guaranteed` to have only one unique set of `k` values in the BST that are closest to the `target`.

#### Example 1:
!["Example 1"](closest1-1-tree.jpg "example 1")
```
Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3], target = 3.714286, k = 2
Output: [4,3]
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: root = [1], target = 0.000000, k = 1
Output: [1]
 ```

#### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is `n`.
- `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4.`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 10^9`
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`
 

**Follow up:** Assume that the BST is balanced. Could you solve it in less than `O(n)` runtime (where `n = total nodes`)?
