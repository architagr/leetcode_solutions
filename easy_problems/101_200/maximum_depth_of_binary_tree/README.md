## Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
### Description 

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's **maximum depth** is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

 

#### Example 1:
![Example 1](tmp-tree.jpg "Example1")
```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
 ```

#### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
