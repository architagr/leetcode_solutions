# Add Strings

Given two non-negative integers, `num1` and `num2` represented as string, return the sum of `num1` and `num2` as a string.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as `BigInteger`). You must also not convert the inputs to integers directly.

## Example 1

```text
Input: num1 = "11", num2 = "123"
Output: "134"
```

## Example 2

```text
Input: num1 = "456", num2 = "77"
Output: "533"
```

## Example 3

```text
Input: num1 = "0", num2 = "0"
Output: "0"
```

## Constraints

- 1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= $ 10^4$
- `num1` and `num2` consist of only digits.
- `num1` and `num2` don't have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.
