## Min Cost to Connect All Points

You are given an array `points` representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D-plane, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`.

The cost of connecting two points `[xi, yi]` and `[xj, yj]` is the **manhattan distance** between them: `|xi - xj| + |yi - yj|`, where `|val|` denotes the absolute value of `val`.

Return _the minimum cost to make all points connected_. All points are connected if there is **exactly one** simple path between any two points.

#### Example 1:

> Input: points = [[0,0],[2,2],[3,10],[5,2],[7,0]] > <br> Output: 20
> <br>Explanation:
> <br> !["Solution1"](c.png) > <br> We can connect the points as shown above to get the minimum cost of 20.
> <br>Notice that there is a unique path between every pair of points.

#### Example 2:

```
Input: points = [[3,12],[-2,5],[-4,1]]
Output: 18
```

#### Constraints:

- `1 <= points.length <= 1000`
- `-10^6 <= xi, yi <= 10^6`
- All pairs `(xi, yi)` are distinct.
