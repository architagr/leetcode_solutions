## Graph Valid Tree

You have a graph of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given an integer n and a list of `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the graph.

Return `true` if the edges of the given graph make up a valid tree, and `false` otherwise.

#### Example 1:

!["Example 1"](tree1-graph.jpg)

```
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,4]]
Output: true
```

#### Example 2:

!["Example 2"](tree2-graph.jpg)

```
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[1,3],[1,4]]
Output: false
```

#### Constraints:

- `1 <= n <= 2000`
- `0 <= edges.length <= 5000`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ai, bi < n`
- `ai != bi`
- There are no self-loops or repeated edges.
