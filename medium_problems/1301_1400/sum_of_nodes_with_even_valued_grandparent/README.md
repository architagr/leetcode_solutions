# Sum of Nodes with Even-Valued Grandparent

Difficulty: Medium

[LeetCode #1315](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-nodes-with-even-valued-grandparent/)

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *the sum of values of nodes with an
**even-valued grandparent***. If there are no nodes with an **even-valued grandparent**,
return `0`.

A **grandparent** of a node is the parent of its parent if it exists.

## Example 1

![Example 1](images/1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [6,7,8,2,7,1,3,9,null,1,4,null,null,null,5]
Output: 18
Explanation: The red nodes are the nodes with even-value grandparent while the blue nodes are the even-value grandparents.
```

## Example 2

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 0
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
