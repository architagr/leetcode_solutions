# Binary Search Tree to Greater Sum Tree

**Difficulty:** Medium
**LeetCode:** [#1038](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-to-greater-sum-tree/)

## Problem statement

Given the `root` of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.

As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

## Examples

### Example 1

![Example 1 tree](images/1.png)

```
Input:  root = [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]
Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]
```

### Example 2

```
Input:  root = [0,null,1]
Output: [1,null,1]
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
- All the values in the tree are unique.

## Note

This question is the same as [538: Convert BST to Greater Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-bst-to-greater-tree/).
