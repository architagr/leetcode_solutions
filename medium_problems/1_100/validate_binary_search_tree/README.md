# Validate Binary Search Tree

Difficulty: Medium

[LeetCode #98](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/)

Given the `root` of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **strictly less** than the
  node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **strictly greater** than the
  node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

## Example 1

![Example 1](images/1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: true
```

## Example 2

![Example 2](images/2.jpg)

```
Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
- `-2^31 <= Node.val <= 2^31 - 1`
